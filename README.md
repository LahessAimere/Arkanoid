## Features
The players move a horizontal bar from right to left, 
supposed to represent a spaceship. This tray at the bottom 
of the screen lets you bounce a ball that destroys the blocks 
at the top of the screen. The player moves to the next level 
when all blocks are destroyed. A player loses every time he 
drops the ball at the bottom of the screen. The game consists 
of 3 levels.
